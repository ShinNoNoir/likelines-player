=== About this policy ===
This privacy and cookie policy governs only
    
    the LikeLines open source software and services ("LikeLines")
    
that are under control by:
    
    the Delft Multimedia Information Retrieval lab 
    of the Delft University of Technology
    and its researchers ("We" or "Us").
    
We do not control the privacy practices of third parties that run their own 
LikeLines servers. LikeLines records your behavior in order to provide you, 
the user, a richer experience in watching online videos by providing more 
enjoyable non-linear video access. This policy describes the information about 
the user ("You" or "Your") that is being recorded, where it is stored, for 
which purposes and whom has access to it this information.


=== Information collected by the LikeLines software ===
LikeLines records the following information about the interactions you perform 
with the video player:

 * The URL of the video loaded into the player and when (the local time of 
   your computer) it was loaded;
 * The current playback position in the video when you play, pause and seek in 
   the video;
 * When (the local time of your computer) you play, pause and seek the video;
 * Periodically, the current playback position in the video and the local time 
   of your computer;
 * The current playback position in the video when you click the Like button;
 * When (the local time of your computer) you click the Like button.


=== Storage and transmission of collected information ===
LikeLines stores collected information at a LikeLines server. The player 
component of LikeLines sends this information (described in the previous 
section) coupled with an identity tracking token (described in the next 
section) to the server periodically. Information is sent through a secure 
channel (https), but only if LikeLines service itself is accessed through a 
secure channel.


=== Identity tracking through cookies ===
LikeLines makes use of persistent cookies to track identities. Cookies are 
small text files that are automatically created and stored by your Internet 
browser. LikeLines cookies contain a unique identifying number that tracks you, 
the user. The purpose of a LikeLines cookie is to recognize you on your next 
visit without requiring you to login using a registered username and password.

This identity tracking token is also stored at a LikeLines server together with 
information collected by the LikeLines video player component. This token does 
not contain or is derived from any personal information. This token is also 
tied to a single browser on a single machine. If you, the user, access LikeLines
on a different machine, the LikeLines server will treat you as a new identity.


=== Purpose of recorded information ===
All information previously described is collected by LikeLines for two purposes:

 1. The information is used by LikeLines itself in order to provide its 
    non-linear video access service to its users.
 2. The information is used by us, researchers, for research on non-linear 
    video access and retrieval and for improving the LikeLines service.


=== Disclosure of recorded information ===
Information collected by LikeLines is never disclosed to third parties without 
your consent. LikeLines only exposes stored information in an anonymous, 
aggregated form in order to allow LikeLines clients (such as the LikeLines 
video player component) to compute the most interesting parts of a video.


=== Adopting this privacy policy for third party developers ===
We highly recommend third party developers to adopt our privacy practices when 
setting up their own LikeLines services by using this policy document as a 
template.
