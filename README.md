LikeLines-Player
============

*Welcome to the new home for the LikeLines player component. The original prototype is still available on the [Knight-Mozilla repository](https://github.com/Knight-Mozilla/likelines-mojo). The revamped source code will be put online shortly.*

## Introduction
Conventional online video players do not make the inner structure of the video apparent, making it hard to jump straight to the interesting parts. LikeLines provides users with a navigable heat map of interesting regions for the videos they are watching. The novelty of LikeLines lies in its combination of content analysis and both explicit and implicit user interactions.

The LikeLines system is being developed in the [Delft Multimedia Information Retrieval Lab](http://dmirlab.tudelft.nl/) at the Delft University of Technology.
